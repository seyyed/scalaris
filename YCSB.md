# Scalaris YCSB Client #

The Scalaris client is not yet part of the official YCSB bundle but a fork of
YCSB with the necessary implementation is available on GitHub.

## Compile ##

Check out the fork of YCSB with branch scalaris:

```
git clone git://github.com/mxm/YCSB.git -b scalaris
```

Build with Maven:

```
cd YCSB
mvn package
```

## Run ##

```
./bin/ycsb load scalaris -P workloads/workloada
./bin/ycsb run scalaris -P workloads/workloada
```

## Troubleshooting ##

If you're experiencing problems, first make sure Scalaris is running. You can pass configuration parameters to YCBS. For instance, if your first Scalaris node is node1@localhost, the configuration looks as follows:

```
./bin/ycsb load scalaris -P workloads/workloada -p scalaris.node="node1@localhost"
```

The following parameters with their default values are available:

```
scalaris.node = "node1@localhost"
scalaris.name = "YCSB"
scalaris.cookie = "chocolate chip cookie"
```
